# 0.3.0.0

- Transducers can now delimit segments in the done function, too.
  This was required for transducers like surround to work as splitters.
- Strengthened the constraints on the surround function to Traversable.
- Added dependency on free and monoid-sublasses.
- group functions extract transductions from an infinite list.
- Added ignore, splitAt, splitWhen, splitLast
- removed drop, take... use splitAt, splitWhen + bisect.
- Added bisect, evenly convenience functions.

# 0.2.1.0

- Comonad and Extend instances for Transducer 
- Added words splitter
- Added take, drop, takeWhile, dropWhile transducers

# 0.2.0.0

- Removed the Spliiter type. Now it's transducers for everything!
- generalizeTransducer -> _generalize
- simplifyTransducer -> _simplify
- removed chokepoint and chokepointM


# 0.1.2.0

- Added explicit bifunctors dependency.
- Added Transduce', TransduceM' type synonyms.
- Added groups', groupsM'.


# 0.1.1.0

- Changed signatures of transduce' and transduceM'.
- generalize' -> generalizeTransducer
- simplify' -> simplifyTransducer
- dropped direct profunctors dependency.
